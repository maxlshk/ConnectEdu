# ConnectEdu

ConnectEdu is an online education platform used for better and easier communication between students and teachers. 

Having interface similar to Threads or Twitter allows modern students to adapt faster to the features of the app and unlock full potential of online student-to-teacher communication.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download) to install dependencies ans start the app.

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or use the live [demo](https://connect-edu.vercel.app/) hosted via Vercel.

## Issues

Pull requests are welcome. The implementation of direct messaging feature was done offhandedly and requires serious improvements. Please make sure to familiarize yourself with the MongoDB [documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) before contributing.
